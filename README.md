Control Arduino Nano MCU via Blynk app for Android using Blynk USB Serial Internet Connection. Display the pin state on 16x2 LCD via i2c converter. I2C converter is used to reduce the occupancy of I/O ports for LCD in microcontroller. This will save the ports in Microcontroller which gives plenty of room to add more sensors and actuators.
